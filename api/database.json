When they first opened, I had a chance to speak to the owner, Novi, who asked me to call back the next day. He had gone out of his way to check for gluten in all the ingredients for the pho, summer rolls, and the vermicelli plate. These items are all gluten-free, but be aware that the sauces that come separately on the side may not be. The siracha is gf, but the hoison is not. We feel that the pho is a safe bet, as it is naturally gf. We've had the pho with the steak, brisket, chicken, and shrimp with no problems, but be aware that the meatballs may not be safe. Also, I think it would be wise to talk to the staff each time you order the vermicelli plate to be sure no sauces containing soy sauce are used on the meat you choose. ",

They have a separate gf prep area with designated utensils, use fresh toppings from the back, and cook the pizza in a designated spot in the oven, using a pizza stone designated for gf only. The two gf crusts they offer are called gluten-free and cauliflower crust, and they can accomodate dairy free as well. Their salads are gf and they even have gf sorbet for dessert. (The gelato is not gf). Please be aware, though, that their sausage is not gf (ask about all toppings) and they only have special prep and cook areas at the Marietta, OH location, not the location in the mall in Vienna, WV.",

The crab dip appetizer is gf with cauliflower flatbread, but is fried in a shared fryer, which makes them not gf anymore.

After eyeing a dish labeled gf on the menu, our hopes were greatly disappointed when the server informed us that the labels were not accurate. She said someone got overly-excited with the gluten-free labels and put them on many dishes that are not, in fact, gf, and she didn't know which items were actually gf. What followed was a frustrating attempt to find something safe to eat, with the server making several trips back and forth to the kitchen to ask questions, us feeling like we were inconveniencing the server, and in the end, we just left without eating anything. One of the worst experiences I've ever had in any restaurant.",
